# Bookstore

### Reference Documentation
#### What is this project for?

The goal of this mini project is to write a simple micro web service to mimic a “Book store”.

Main purpose of the application is for users to easily search books by genres, title, author and other keywords. 
Create favorite book lists and rate books. Users can also see other user’s ratings, and the application can 
display the top-rated books per genre.

Each book has one or more authors and one publisher.
Also, any book has its cover image, and user has its profile image.
Also, for testing we have .csv files from which we can fill our database with users, books and rates.

Users can have three roles.
-	*admin* - can add new book, new author, new genres in the bookstore and add new admin users, and import .csv files
-	*editor* - can update books
-	*user* - can view books, add to favorite-book list, and rate books
